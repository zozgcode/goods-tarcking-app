          Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
          “Diversity and inclusion have been part of the FedEx DNA since day
          one. We’ve known for years what various studies now prove — that
          workforce diversity and inclusion are key drivers of business success,
          and we too embrace these values not only in our recruiting and hiring,
          but also in our relationships with suppliers and the charitable
          organizations we invest in. Commitment to diversity creates a better
          experience for our team members and our customers.” - Frederick W.
          Smith - Chairman & CEO FedEx Corporation
